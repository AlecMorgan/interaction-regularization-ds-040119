    "### Bias and Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias is easy to wrap one's mind around: Imagine pulling three red balls from an urn that has hundreds of balls of all colors in a uniform distribution. Then my sample is a terrible representative of the whole population. If I were to build a model by extrapolating from my sample, that model would predict that _every_ ball produced would be red! That is, this model would be incredibly biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance is a little bit harder to visualize, but it's basically the \"opposite\" of this. Imagine that the population of balls in the urn is mostly red, but also that there are a few balls of other colors floating around. Now imagine that our sample comprises a few balls, none of which is red. In this case, we've essentially picked up on the \"noise\", rather than the \"signal\". If I were to build a model by extrapolating from my sample, that model would be needlessly complex. It might predict that balls drawn before noon will be orange and that balls drawn after 8pm will be green, when the reality is that a simple model that predicted 'red' for all balls would be a superior model!\n",
    "\n",
    "The important idea here is that there is a _trade-off_: If we have too few data in our sample (training set), or too few predictors, we run the risk of high _bias_, i.e. an underfit model. On the other hand, if we have too many predictors (especially ones that are collinear), we run the risk of high _variance_, i.e. an overfit model.\n",

    "Suppose I have split my data into training and testing sets. Do I want my model to fit my training data _exactly_?\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the answer is actually 'NO!', because doing that will lead to an overfit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is generally a result of high variance. High variance can be caused by:\n",
    "- having irrelevant or too many predictors\n",
    "- multicollinearity\n",
    "- large coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is about picking up on noise rather than signal.\n",
    "The second problem is about having a least-squares estimate that is highly sensitive to random error.\n",
    "The third is about having highly sensitive predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is about introducing a factor into our model designed to enforce the stricture that the coefficients stay small, by penalizing the ones that get too large.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we'll alter our loss function so that the goal now is not merely to minimize the difference between actual values and our model's predicted values. Rather, we'll add in a term to our loss function that represents the sizes of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two popular ways of doing this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (\"L1\"): Minimize $\\large\\Sigma^{n_{obs.}}_{i=1}[(y_i - \\Sigma^{n_{feat.}}_{j=0}\\beta_j\\times x_{ij})^2 + \\lambda\\Sigma^{n_{feat.}}_{j=0}|\\beta_j|]$\n",
    "<br/> <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge (\"L2\"): Minimize $\\large\\Sigma^{n_{obs.}}_{i=1}[(y_i - \\Sigma^{n_{feat.}}_{j=0}\\beta_j\\times x_{ij})^2 + \\lambda\\Sigma^{n_{feat.}}_{j=0}\\beta^2_j]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\rightarrow$ Don't let these formulas be intimidating. The first term in each of these (the sum of squares) is the same, and is just the familiar loss function that we've always used. What distinguishes the Lasso Regression from the Ridge Regression is only the extra term on the right. The Lasso uses the absolute values of the coefficients, while the Ridge uses the squares of the coefficients.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given value of $\\lambda$, the Ridge makes for a gentler reining in of runaway coefficients. The Lasso will more quickly reduce the contribution of individual predictors down to insignificance.\n",
